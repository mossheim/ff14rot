better logging
mode where you put in list of actions and see play-by-play of damage output
configurable delay time

time holes:
- specify target available or not (for bloodfest)
- only allow no mercy, potion, maybe bloodfest
- branches: 0-3 actions squeezed before end of hole
    - a branch for each ordering

future?
- specify target in melee range or not (for ranged)
